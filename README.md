## Usage
To run the project, use the following command:

streamlit run app.py

This will start a Streamlit web application where you can input laptop features and get the predicted price.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is laptop.csv, which contains the following columns:

Company: The company that manufactures the laptop.
TypeName: The type of laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Notebook).
Inches: The screen size of the laptop.
ScreenResolution: The screen resolution of the laptop.
Cpu: The CPU model.
Ram: The amount of RAM in GB.
Memory: The storage capacity and type.
Gpu: The GPU model.
OpSys: The operating system.
Weight: The weight of the laptop in kg.
Price: The price of the laptop.
## Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:

Dropping unnecessary columns.
Cleaning and converting data types for Ram and Weight.
Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
## Model Training
The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms. The steps include:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluating the models using metrics like RMSE and RÂ²

## Deployment
The model is deployed using Streamlit to create an interactive web application. The app allows users to input laptop features and get the predicted price
